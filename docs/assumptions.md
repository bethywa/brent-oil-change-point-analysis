# Assumptions and Limitations  
## Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis

This document outlines the key assumptions and limitations underlying the analysis of
Brent oil prices and the planned change point modeling approach. Clearly stating these
factors is essential for responsible interpretation of results.

---

## 1. Key Assumptions

### 1.1 Market Representation Assumption
It is assumed that Brent crude oil prices adequately represent global oil market dynamics,
including supply–demand balance, geopolitical risks, and macroeconomic shocks.

---

### 1.2 Event Timing Assumption
Geopolitical events, policy decisions, and economic shocks are assumed to influence oil
prices close to their reported start dates. However, markets may react before or after
official event dates due to expectations or delayed effects.

---

### 1.3 Regime-Based Behavior Assumption
The analysis assumes that oil prices evolve through distinct regimes characterized by
different statistical properties (mean and volatility), and that these regimes can be
identified using change point models.

---

### 1.4 Log Return Transformation Assumption
Log returns are assumed to provide a more stationary and statistically stable
representation of price movements than raw price levels, making them suitable for
time-series modeling.

---

### 1.5 Independence Within Regimes
Within each detected regime, price changes are assumed to be generated by a stable
stochastic process, even though the overall series is non-stationary across time.

---

## 2. Limitations of the Analysis

### 2.1 Correlation vs. Causation
Change point detection identifies **statistical correlations in time**, not causal
relationships. While detected change points may align with known geopolitical or
economic events, this alignment does not prove that those events directly caused the
observed price changes.

---

### 2.2 Overlapping and Confounding Events
Multiple events often occur close together in time (e.g., economic crises and policy
responses), making it difficult to isolate the effect of any single event on oil prices.

---

### 2.3 Market Expectations and Information Leakage
Oil markets are forward-looking. Prices may react to anticipated events before their
official occurrence, leading to misalignment between detected change points and
documented event dates.

---

### 2.4 Data Frequency Limitations
The analysis uses daily price data, which may obscure intraday price movements and
short-term market reactions. Sudden shocks occurring within a single day may not be
fully captured.

---

### 2.5 Model Sensitivity
Bayesian change point models are sensitive to prior assumptions and model specifications.
Different priors or model structures may lead to variations in detected change points.

---

### 2.6 External Influences Not Explicitly Modeled
Factors such as currency fluctuations, interest rates, inventory levels, and speculative
trading behavior are not explicitly included in the model, despite their potential
influence on oil prices.

---

## 3. Implications for Interpretation

The results of this analysis should be interpreted as **probabilistic and exploratory**,
not definitive causal conclusions. Change point detection provides valuable insights into
**when** significant shifts occur in the oil market, but additional economic and
geopolitical analysis is required to establish **why** those shifts happened.

---

## 4. Conclusion

By clearly stating these assumptions and limitations, the analysis maintains transparency
and analytical rigor. This foundation supports responsible interpretation of change point
results and ensures alignment with real-world market complexities.
